# react-pixi-dragonbones

The goal of this project is to be a personal site.
The idea is to run a DragonBones spine animation in PixiJS and bundle it into a react app with create-react-app.
That way one can use the great tools in DragonBones to make beautiful animations, run them performantly in the browser and build the UI in a robust way with React.

For now the app is a personal page, but it could expanded into a gallery with more animated artwork, a game, or any other interactive media.

The core technologies used are:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux)
- [Typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)
- [DragonBonesJS](https://github.com/DragonBones/DragonBonesJS) for PixiJS
